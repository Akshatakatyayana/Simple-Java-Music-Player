# Simple-Java-MP3-Player
Simple Java MP3 player for fun. I got a lot farther since the beginning. :)</br>

Created using Swing and JMF. 

<b>How to load a playlist..</b></br>
  1. Within the "model" directory, create a "music" folder and place all the song files in there (Note: Java doesn't support MP3s, or at least JMF doesn't.. so I converted the MP3s to WAVs.).</br>
  2. Within the "controller" directory, create a "playlists" folder. In there, create a "playlist1.txt" file. You can change the implementation so that it takes whatever file name you want.

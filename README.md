# Simple-Java-MP3-Player
Simple Java MP3 player for fun. I got a lot farther since the beginning. :)</br>

Created using Swing and JMF. To load a playlist, go into the "model" folder, and create a "music" folder with all the song files (Note: MP3's don't work with Java). Then, go into the "controller" directory, and create a "playlists" folder. In there, create a "playlist1.txt" file. You can change the implementation so that it takes whatever file name you want.
